      <p style="color: black; padding: 20px;"><strong>Probability</strong> is the branch of mathematics concerning numerical descriptions of how likely an event is to occur, or how likely it is that a proposition is true. The probability of an event is a number between 0 and 1, where, roughly speaking, 0 indicates impossibility of the event and 1 indicates certainty.[note 1][1][2] The higher the probability of an event, the more likely it is that the event will occur. A simple example is the tossing of a fair (unbiased) coin. Since the coin is fair, the two outcomes ('heads' and 'tails') are both equally probable; the probability of 'heads' equals the probability of 'tails'; and since no other outcomes are possible, the probability of either 'heads' or 'tails' is 1/2 (which could also be written as 0.5 or 50%).</p>
      <p style="color: black ; padding: 20px;">Problems on Probability with solutions:<br>
        Example 1: A coin is thrown 3 times .what is the probability that atleast one head is obtained?<br>
        <br>Sol: Sample space = [HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, TTH, THT, HTT, TTT]<br>
        Total number of ways = 2 × 2 × 2 = 8.  Fav. Cases = 7
        P (A) = 7/8<br>
        OR<br>
        P (of getting at least one head) = 1 – P (no head)⇒ 1 – (1/8) = 7/8<br>
        <br>Example 2:<br> Find the probability of getting a numbered card when a card is drawn from the pack of 52 cards.<br>
        <br>Sol: Total Cards = 52. Numbered Cards = (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) 9 from each suit 4 × 9 = 36
        P (E) = 36/52 = 9/13<br>
        <br>Example 3:<br> There are 5 green 7 red balls. Two balls are selected one by one without replacement. Find the probability that first is green and second is red.<br>
        <br>Sol: P (G) × P (R) = (5/12) x (7/11) = 35/132<br>
        <br>Example 4:<br> What is the probability of getting a sum of 7 when two dice are thrown?<br>
        Sol:  Probability math - Total number of ways = 6 × 6 = 36 ways. Favorable cases = (1, 6) (6, 1) (2, 5) (5, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) --- 6 ways. P (A) = 6/36 = 1/6<br>
        Example 5:<br> 1 card is drawn at random from the pack of 52 cards.<br>
        (i) Find the Probability that it is an honor card.<br>
        (ii) It is a face card.<br><br>
        Sol: (i) honor cards = (A, J, Q, K) 4 cards from each suits = 4 × 4 = 16<br>
        P (honor card) = 16/52 = 4/13<br>
        (ii) face cards = (J,Q,K) 3 cards from each suit = 3 × 4 = 12 Cards.<br>
        P (face Card) = 12/52 = 3/13</p>
